NFL Prediction Model Ideas

BRAINSTORM

	Baseline: Ridge Regression (for yards) + XGBoost (for TD probability).

	Advanced: LSTM or Transformer sequence model that takes in a player’s last N games + opponent features to predict next game stats.

	Baseline: 
		cont: Linear regression + lasso/ridge
		binary: logistic regression

	Simple: xgboost/lightgbm
	
	Timeseries: LSTMs/Temporal Convolution Networks/RNNs
	
	Hybrid: 
		-Stacked Models: xgboost for feature extraction + neural net for temporal dependencies
		-Simulation: monte carlo informed on predictive distributions 
		-Player Archetypes: Cluster players into similar styles (e.g., “workhorse RB” vs. “third-down RB”) and predict within clusters.

	

	Simple Pipeline:
		Feature engineering (player, team, matchup, context).

		Gradient boosted trees for structured/tabular prediction.

		Sequential model (LSTM/Transformer) for time dependencies.

		Ensemble the outputs for final prediction.




	Evaluation Metrics:

		Continuous stats (yards, receptions, carries): MAE, RMSE.

		Probabilistic outcomes (TDs, receptions ≥ X): Brier score, log loss, calibration curves.

		Fantasy relevance: Compare predicted fantasy points vs. actual (PPR, half-PPR, standard).



	Feature Engineering: rolling averages, strength of schedule adjustments, pace, Vegas lines are often more predictive than raw stats.

	Ensembles: combining linear + tree-based + neural nets often boosts accuracy.

	Regular Updates: NFL is dynamic (injuries, depth chart changes), so retraining weekly with up-to-date data helps.
