NFL Prediction Model Ideas

	Baseline: Linear regression + lasso/ridge
	Simple: xgboost/lightgbm
	
	Timeseries: LSTMs/Temporal Convolution Networks
	
	Hybrid: 
		-Stacked Models: xgboost for feature extraction + neural net for temporal dependencies
		-Simulation: monte carlo informed on predictive distributions 
		-Player Archetypes: Cluster players into similar styles (e.g., “workhorse RB” vs. “third-down RB”) and predict within clusters.
